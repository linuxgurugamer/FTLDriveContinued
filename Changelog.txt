	New animated models supplied by forum user @steedcrugeon
	Code added to control animations
	Drives can now stack

0.1.4
	Fixed UI issue

0.1.5
	Updated stacking to be a descending exponential curve for additional drives.  It is now using the formula:
		force * 1.4 ^ (-cnt)
		Where force = generated force by drive
		cnt = cnt of additional drive mode.
		So this means that the following applies to additional drives:
		Drive #		Multiplier
			2		0.714285714
			3		0.510204082
			4		0.364431487
			5		0.260308205
			6		0.185934432
			7		0.132810309
			8		0.094864506
			9		0.067760362
			10		0.048400258
